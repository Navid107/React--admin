# React Data charts and Dashboard with @syncfusion

## What is @syncfusion? 
"@syncfusion is a .NET-based software product offering 1600+ components and frameworks that can be used in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code for developing stunning applications."

In this project I learned how to display a data and dataGrid in a front end application such as React.
syncfusion is a very friendly library and it makes it very easy to work it.
